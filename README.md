The Simple Password Generator is a small project i'm working on my free time.

It's meant to be a simple HTML (With some JavaScript) page with a few options for generating a desired random password.

The options it should have are the choices of:

- Uppercase characters
- Lowercase characters
- Symbols
- Numbers
- Amount of characters

This file will be updated as the project progresses.
